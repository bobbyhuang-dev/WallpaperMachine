# Changelog

Every published version, newest first. Each section is written when its version is
cut, by [`scripts/release_notes.py`](scripts/release_notes.py) from the commits
between two version tags: a language model writes them up for users, where older
sections list the commits. The GitHub Release body and the app's What's new card
repeat the section, so the three always say the same thing. See
[docs/release.md](docs/release.md) for how a version is cut.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-26

WallpaperMachine 1.0 ships as a drag-to-install disk image and adds a first-run guide with Steam sign-in, optional now-playing support for music wallpapers and many scene rendering fixes.

### New

- Downloads and in-app updates now come as a drag-to-install disk image with first-launch steps under System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway
- A first-run welcome guide sets language and appearance, signs in to Steam and shares tips, and can be reopened from Settings → Library & Steam
- Music wallpapers can optionally show the current track, cover art and playback state from your Mac's now-playing information once you allow media access
- Play, pause, next and previous buttons inside music wallpapers can now control the player you are using, starting on the action the button's name suggests
- Choose how many Workshop downloads run at once in Settings → Library & Steam → Downloads at once, from 1 to 6
- Settings → General has a Language picker for System (Auto), English and Simplified Chinese that switches the panel in place
- The control panel has a Wallpaper Engine-style filter sidebar with Workshop filters for type, age rating, resolution and tags, plus more Discover sort orders
- Installed can be filtered with the same sidebar boxes as Discover and sorted by name, type, favorites, file size or date added
- Wallpapers that let you choose your own picture now show the picture you pick instead of the packaged artwork
- Tiles show corner marks for staff-approved items, favorites and wallpapers already in your library
- Report a problem on GitHub now opens with the wallpaper's details filled in
- Choose between new branded app icons
- Settings → About shows what changed in the newest release
- The optional Native Metal renderer now draws effects, video, text layers, puppets, particle trails and sprite sheets

### Improved

- Scenes with many large images open much faster because their images are decoded once and in parallel
- Newly connected displays start enabled with the main display's wallpaper, and turning one off is remembered across reconnections
- The Discover download ring names the current step, such as Connecting or Signing in, and shows Finishing while files are checked and imported
- Discover previews download once, are kept on disk and play sooner, and resizing the window no longer reloads the page
- The frame rate limit you set is now respected by wallpapers that react to the pointer
- Changing tracks on a music wallpaper no longer reloads the whole wallpaper or restarts its videos
- Heavy 3D wallpapers get more time to show their first frame, and later launches reach it faster
- Scene wallpapers do less redundant drawing work while playing
- Control panel text is rewritten in plain language and every message, menu and error is now translated into Simplified Chinese
- Checking for updates no longer reports an error when no release has been published yet

### Fixed

- Wallpapers no longer disappear when you hide the app with Cmd-H or after activating a wallpaper
- The app restores your own wallpapers at launch instead of posters or selections inherited from another display
- Scene video textures no longer freeze after half a second, and 4K video scenes no longer fail with no first frame
- The internal render scale setting now takes effect on scene wallpapers
- Wallpaper buttons no longer stay stuck shrunk after being pressed
- Sounds bound to a wallpaper's volume slider now follow the slider
- Camera intros in 2D scenes play, and masked or parallax layers stay in place instead of sliding out of view
- 2D wallpapers with a camera layer no longer show only a small patch in one corner
- Blurred layers no longer flatten into a grey wash in the Compatibility renderer
- Effects written for Wallpaper Engine that were silently dropped now appear on their layers
- Audio-responsive elements react to sound on the Native Metal renderer instead of turning black
- Heavy 3D scenes no longer collapse to a column or lose skies, rings and large meshes
- Mouse trails follow the cursor near screen edges instead of drifting away from it
- Parallax no longer pushes grouped layers aside and uncovers what is beneath them
- Scripted dock icons in wallpapers now scale, fade and open as intended
- Album covers keep their authored shape instead of turning into circles
- Music wallpapers no longer go blank after changing a setting until playback is paused and resumed
- The lock screen status row now shows the real reason the experimental animated lock screen failed to start
- Applying a wallpaper no longer turns a mirrored display back into an independent one
- Installed tiles no longer show a leftover Discover preview animation
- Web wallpaper options keep their types and authored order
- Some control panel error messages no longer appear in English when the panel is in Chinese
