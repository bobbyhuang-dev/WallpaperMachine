//! Synchronous, lifetime-safe access to live scene state.
//!
//! The values a settings pane shows — how a scene is being updated, which
//! backend drew it — live behind a raw renderer pointer the engine actor owns.
//! Reading them must not block the caller on the actor's mailbox: a settings
//! snapshot is built on the bridge actor, and making it wait on the engine
//! actor would turn any engine stall into a frozen panel.
//!
//! So scenes publish themselves here when they open and withdraw before they
//! are destroyed, both under this registry's lock. A reader holding the lock
//! therefore cannot observe a pointer whose scene is being torn down, and the
//! reads themselves are relaxed atomic loads inside the renderer.
